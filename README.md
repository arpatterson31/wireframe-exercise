This is my lab 08a project to build construct a wireframe for a website.

### Reflections and Comments
* This was a great exercise and it was great to see how to quickly draw up wireframes for a website. There is a lot for me to still learn on writing CSS and figuring out how to style top to bottom, left to right.
